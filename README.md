# Python
Code from learning python.
The folder named "Tutorials" contains python code copied from youtube tutorials or any other online tutorials that I find.
Most tutorials are followed from thenewboston YT channel. None of the tutorial code is mine. They are purely there for reference in
case I forget something from python.
